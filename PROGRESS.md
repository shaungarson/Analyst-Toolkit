# Analyst Toolkit — Progress

**Last verified:** 2026-09-03 (Driver-Based DCF: standardized ±1pp driver sensitivity —
tornado). Committed as `a4430ce`, CI run #28 green, **deployed to Vercel and Render and
production-verified**. Backend 216 tests, frontend 223 tests, lint and production build clean.

Production verification against the live app: the Costco demo activated and switched to
Driver-Based, with `performance` showing exactly three backend calls — `driver-valuation`,
`driver-sensitivity` and **`driver-tornado` (104 ms on Render)** — and **no `/api/company/`
request at all**, so the demo stays provider-independent. Run Valuation returned
**$263.25/share**, matching the previously production-verified Driver Base Case, with the
tornado rendering above the WACC × terminal-growth grid and ranking every driver by tested
range: **D&A and CapEx tied at the top** (−$142.10 / +$142.10 each, mirrored), then EBIT Margin
(−$107.21 / +$107.22), Revenue Growth (−$14.31 / +$14.97), Tax Rate (+$4.88 / −$4.87) and NWC
Investment (+$4.16 / −$4.16). D&A's **−1pp endpoint is marked `caution · Negative D&A %
(yrs 1-5)`** — the only flagged endpoint in the run, and the one that drives the top-ranked
row. Both sign reversals render correctly: Tax Rate and NWC Investment each have their −1pp
endpoint *raising* value, drawn right of the zero line rather than forced left. The Fade row
summarizes as `7.46% → 2.50% over 5 years`; flat rows show `base · tested x and y`, including
the negative `-3.00% · tested -4.00% and -2.00%` NWC row. Mode-switch lifecycle confirmed live:
switching to Quick DCF clears the tornado, switching back does not resurrect it from stale
state, and a fresh Run Valuation restores it with its warning mark intact. Lane labels stay
clear of the bars and the page never scrolls horizontally. Browser console clean throughout.

## Current Milestone

**None in progress.** The Driver-Based ±1pp sensitivity tornado (see below) is complete,
committed, deployed, and production-verified. One bounded milestone: one backend calculation,
one route, one chart. The valuation engine, warning tiers, completeness rules and shared
valuation core are untouched — `run_driver_dcf` is called thirteen times rather than
reimplemented. Full design and verification record:
[`docs/decisions.md`](docs/decisions.md#driver-based-dcf-standardized-1pp-driver-sensitivity-tornado);
methodology: [`docs/MODELING_CONVENTIONS.md`](docs/MODELING_CONVENTIONS.md).

## Blockers / Frozen Areas

- **Real estate is frozen** — no further changes until the user validates underwriting
  conventions with a CRE professional. See [docs/decisions.md#real-estate-freeze-pending-professional-validation](docs/decisions.md#real-estate-freeze-pending-professional-validation).

## Recently Shipped

- 2026-09-03 — **Driver-Based DCF: standardized ±1pp driver sensitivity (tornado).** The first
  sensitivity treatment of Driver mode's own drivers — the existing grid tests WACC × terminal
  growth, neither of which is a driver. `POST /api/dcf/driver-tornado` runs thirteen
  `run_driver_dcf` calls (one base, computed server-side rather than trusted from the client,
  plus six drivers × two directions) applying a ±1pp parallel shift across every forecast year,
  so Fade and Custom rows keep their shape. Ranked by the spread across the base value and both
  endpoints, not the endpoint distance alone — identical when the endpoints straddle base, but
  correct when they don't, which happens for real: NWC investment reverses sign in a
  declining-revenue year, revenue growth reverses against a negative-revenue year, and
  `max(EBIT, 0) × tax_rate` kinks at EBIT = 0. An endpoint whose shift introduces a driver
  warning the base case doesn't already raise is marked with its tier, short name and affected
  years — never clamped or skipped, since substituting a different assumption than the stated
  ±1pp would make the comparison unreliable. Rendered as a real table with a bar column (values
  readable without hover, the table's own semantics carrying accessibility with no duplicated
  summary, no chart library and deliberately no shared charting layer yet). WACC and terminal
  growth excluded as non-drivers, with a neutral pointer to their own grid that claims nothing
  about relative magnitude. Committed `a4430ce`, CI run #28 green, deployed and
  production-verified (see Last verified above) —
  [decisions.md](docs/decisions.md#driver-based-dcf-standardized-1pp-driver-sensitivity-tornado)
- 2026-09-03 — **Costco demo: a provider-independent Driver Base Case.** Reverses v1's
  Quick-only restriction — the demo now populates a complete, deterministic five-year Driver
  Base Case (revenue growth Fade to the shared terminal growth rate; EBIT margin, tax, D&A and
  CapEx Flat at their historical medians, all badged Seeded) alongside the unchanged Quick-mode
  Low/Base/High presets, computed from the same frozen snapshot via the same
  `driverHistory()`/`buildBaseForecast()` pipeline Initialize Forecast uses for any company. NWC
  Investment is force-set to an explicit `-3.0% Flat` demo assumption rather than seeded, since
  Costco's own working-capital history is correctly refused as unstable, and stays unbadged with
  its own Unstable badge still visible. Leaving the demo via a live company load now resets the
  driver schedule even when the ticker matches. No engine, methodology, or backend change.
  Committed `7e4c21c`, CI run #26 green, deployed and production-verified (see Last Verified
  above) — [decisions.md](docs/decisions.md#costco-demo-a-provider-independent-driver-base-case)
- 2026-09-03 — **Guidance for unstable NWC assumptions.** The NWC Investment row's Unstable
  badge is now an accessible popover trigger (not just plain text) explaining what the refusal
  means and how to proceed — a normalized assumption, 0% if none is defensible, sensitivity-tested
  both directions. Opens on click or keyboard activation; closes via its own close button,
  Escape, or an outside click, with focus returned to the trigger every time. No change to
  instability rules, seeding logic, or forecast behavior. Committed `31bc1fc`, CI run #26 green,
  deployed and production-verified (see Last Verified above).
- 2026-09-03 — **Driver-Based DCF v2: evidence-led forecast entry.** Per-driver historical
  evidence (every usable observation plus one normalized reference statistic — median for five
  drivers, aggregate ΣΔNWC ÷ ΣΔRevenue for working capital); an explicit **Initialize Forecast**
  action that shows its plan and basis before writing anything and badges what it writes as
  historical-derived starting points; refusal rather than a weak seed where history is thin,
  unstable or sign-flipping; **Flat / Fade / Custom** row modes with the annual grid
  repositioned as the advanced schedule editor; a one-time (never live) "use terminal growth as
  target" action; real fiscal-year column labels where the fiscal period is unambiguous;
  and instructional text reduced to one line plus a print-preserving disclosure. A closeout
  correction pass then hardened the NWC aggregate denominator (direction-reversal and
  net-versus-gross checks), replaced per-row seed clearing with a whole-schedule reset that
  preserves only a positively-identified same-ticker reload, surfaced every material note plus
  excluded-period counts and reasons, gave
  observations visible fiscal-year labels, and removed the duplicated step badge. Rejected in
  scope: historical price correlation / "revenue beta", and any frontend duplication of the
  backend projection. Committed `9d06901`, CI run #24 green, deployed and production-verified

## Next Actions

1. Driver-Based follow-ups in [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md)'s Later column: the two-way
   **Revenue Growth × EBIT Margin** table (the tornado has now settled the perturbation
   convention it was waiting on), and **Quick DCF FCF-growth sensitivity**, which no existing
   surface covers.
2. Separately raised and deliberately not bundled into the tornado commit: the **Seeded →
   History-informed** terminology change on driver badges.
3. Real estate: no action planned until the user has the CRE-professional conversation.
