# Analyst Toolkit — Progress

## Current Phase
Phase 1 — Foundation (core setup complete)

## Done
* React + Vite frontend scaffolded (`frontend/`)
* FastAPI backend scaffolded (`backend/`), with a Python venv and pinned `requirements.txt`
* Local dev setup confirmed end-to-end: frontend (port 5173) calls backend (port 8000) via a Vite dev proxy on `/api/*`, backend responds via `/api/health`
* Git repo initialized

## In Progress
* (nothing yet)

## Near-Term Next Steps
* Start Phase 2: Real Estate Underwriting MVP (Section 3 V1 scope)
* Design the calculation module structure in the backend (separate financial logic from route handlers)
* Build the first input form (purchase price, NOI, financing assumptions) in the frontend

## Deferred (intentionally, for now)
* Real estate: multi-year cash flows, rent/NOI growth, acquisition/disposition costs, refinancing, multiple debt tranches, sensitivity analysis, scenario comparison, waterfalls/promotes
* DCF: historical financials, revenue-driver forecasts, margin/working-capital/CapEx modeling, WACC build-up, comparable-company inputs, scenario analysis
* TypeScript adoption
* Backend / database / auth / cloud storage
* AI analyst features (Phase 9)

## Decision Log

**2026-08-12 — Stack: React + Vite, plain JavaScript**
Alternatives considered: plain HTML/CSS/JS (simpler but less portfolio-recognizable), TypeScript from day one (adds learning overhead before it pays off).
Chosen because React is the most recognizable choice for the target audience and supports the stated learning goal of understanding component architecture; TypeScript deferred until the codebase justifies it.

**2026-08-12 — Backend: Python (FastAPI), added from day one**
Alternatives considered: no backend, calculations done in JavaScript in the browser (simpler, no deployment/CORS complexity, was the original plan).
Chosen despite the added setup because Python is the language most associated with analyst/data work, and this keeps the door open for heavier data analysis later (comps pulls, backtesting) without a later migration. Tradeoff accepted: more moving parts for V1 (two languages, two deployments, network calls between them) in exchange for using the "right" language for the domain from the start.

**2026-08-12 — Real estate V1 scope: single-period + basic debt amortization**
Alternatives considered: single-period only (simpler, faster to ship); multi-year from the start (more realistic but slower and riskier for a first milestone).
Chosen as the middle ground — debt amortization is core to real analyst underwriting credibility, but full multi-year modeling is deferred to keep V1 shippable.

**2026-08-12 — Local scenario saving: localStorage first**
Chosen over an immediate backend to stay consistent with the frontend-first philosophy (Section 10 of CLAUDE.md). Revisit only if localStorage proves genuinely limiting.

**2026-08-12 — Frontend/backend connected via Vite dev proxy, not hardcoded URLs**
Alternatives considered: hardcoding `http://localhost:8000` in frontend fetch calls (simpler but breaks in production and couples frontend to a specific backend host/port).
Chosen because it keeps frontend code environment-agnostic (`/api/*` works locally and in deployment with reverse-proxy config) and avoids CORS complexity in the browser during development.
